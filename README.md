## Tamper

Tamper is a serialization protocol for categorical data.  It allows fast and efficent transfer of bulk datasets from server to browser.

Encoders are available in [Ruby]() and [Go]().  Currently, the deseralizer is only implemented in [javascript](https://github.com/newsdev/tamper/blob/opensource/clients/js/tamper.js).
