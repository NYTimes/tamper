## Tamper

Tamper is a serialization protocol for categorical data. It allows you to quickly and efficently transfer bulk datasets from server to browser.

Encoders are available in [Ruby](https://github.com/NYTimes/tamper/tree/master/encoders/ruby), [Go](https://github.com/NYTimes/tamper/tree/master/encoders/go), and [JavaScript](https://github.com/oztu/tamp).  Currently, the deserializer is only implemented in [JavaScript](https://github.com/NYTimes/tamper/blob/master/clients/js/src/tamper.js).
